JavaScript also has a Math module which contains more advanced functions:

Math.abs calculates the absolute value of a number
Math.exp calculates e to the power of a number
Math.pow(x,y) calculates the result of x to the power of y
Math.floor removes the fraction part from a number
Math.random() will give a random number x where 0<=x<1
And many more mathematical functions.
